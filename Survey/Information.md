## How does research treat underrepresented minorities?

Welcome to the survey 'How does research treat underrepresented minorities?'! 

Thank you for taking the time to participate, your help is very much appreciated!

### What is this survey about?
The LGBTQ* community has sparked the interest of several researchers, for example in psychology, social science, or neuroscience. Although some of these studies are initiated by members of the community, most of them are purely academic, and it is unclear whether they reflect the views and needs of LGBTQ* communities. In this survey, we want to evaluate how members of LGBTQ* communities perceive research that concerns them, or their community at large. We want to evaluate whether you perceive such research as (a) ethical, (b) useful, and (c) respectful.

### Who can participate in this survey?
We want to hear from people who identify anywhere on the LGBTQ* spectrum, and who are older than 18 years. Although the survey asks about your
experiece with academic research, you do *not* need to have participated in any research studies or have any.

### What kind of information will be collected?
This survey is run on the Surveymonkey platform. Surveymonkey wonâ€™t register the IP address of the device you are using for this survey. We do not have access to your name/email, and we have no way to know who you are. In this sense this is an anonymous survey. Once we complete the survey by collecting and analyzing the data, we will publish our findings in an open access format.

### What are the risks of participating in this survey?
We do not anticipate any particular risks from your participation in the survey that would put you in more danger than everyday life activities. If for any reason you feel uncomfortable you can skip any of the questions or exit the survey at any time without giving a reason.
