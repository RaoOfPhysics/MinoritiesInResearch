## How does research treat underrepresented minorities?

Welcome to the survey 'How does research treat underrepresented minorities?'! 

Thank you for taking the time to participate, your help is very much appreciated!

### Who can participate in this survey?
We want to hear from people who identify anywhere on the LGBTQ* spectrum, and who are older than 18 years. Although the survey asks about your
experiece with academic research, you do *not* need to have participated in any research studies or have any.

### What is this survey about?
The LGBTQ* community has sparked the interest of several researchers, for example in psychology, social science, or neuroscience. Although some of these studies are initiated by members of the community, most of them are purely academic, and it is unclear whether they reflect the views and needs of LGBTQ* communities. In this survey, we want to evaluate how members of LGBTQ* communities perceive research that concerns them and their orientation, or their community at large.
