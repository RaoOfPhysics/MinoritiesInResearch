## What is the goal of this project?

#### The problem
* Research is mostly governed by Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic individuals, leaving the vast majority of population underrepresented.
* Moreover, most studies are goverened by a divide between researchers and participants: reseachers design studies and make all key decisions. Although participants' views and needs may be totally different, they are rarely consulted! 

#### Our goal
The goal of this project is to evaluate how members of underrepresented minorities perceive research that directly concerns them. To this aim, we will collectively design a questionnaire to quantify to which extend research that concerns members of geographical, cultural, gender, sexual or other minority groups view research done on them as ethical, useful and respectful.
