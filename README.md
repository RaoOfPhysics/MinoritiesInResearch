# How does research treat underrepresented minorities?

The goal of this project is to evaluate how members of underrepresented minorities perceive research that directly concerns them. To this aim, we will collectively design a questionnaire to quantify to which extend research that concerns members of geographical, cultural, gender, sexual or other minority groups view research done on them as ethical, useful and respectful.
